          <p>
            After exploring different career paths, I discovered my passion for
            web development and made the exciting decision to transition into
            tech. I recently completed an intensive front-end development
            bootcamp where I learned modern web technologies and best practices.

          <p>
            My diverse background brings a unique perspective to problem-solving
            and user experience design. I'm excited to apply my newfound
            technical skills alongside my strong work ethic and eagerness to
            learn in a professional development role.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me working on personal projects,
            contributing to coding communities, or exploring the latest web
            development trends and technologies.
